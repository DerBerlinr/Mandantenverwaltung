# Mandantenverwaltung
A program for administrating clients. WIP
## How to run
Just don't.  
### If you want to run it anyways
1. Make sure Python3 is installed
2. Clone the project using ```https://github.com/DerBerlinr/Mandantenverwaltung/```
3. Run ```gui.py``` using ```python gui.py``` in the cloned directory
## Note
This project isn't finished by any means. It's just bad code written by me many years ago.
